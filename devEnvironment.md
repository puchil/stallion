It is very important for a system to provide users with easier/predefined set of tools to write ui code. We shouldn't just create a window manager, but also build the necessary toolkit for the window manager and all the tools that are build in.

The best example I can think of is the https://material.angular.io/components/categories where a set of predefined components are provided for the users to build on.

These UI materials should change based on the versions and improvements shouldn't break existing software (Like a good library)
